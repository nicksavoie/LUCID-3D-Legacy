# LUCID-3D-Legacy

**Game Engine Toy Project (2011–2013)**

LUCID 3D was a personal project aimed at learning advanced programming concepts by building a video game engine. The goal was to create a suite of user-friendly tools enabling creative friends without programming experience to design games collaboratively.

## Learning Focus

This project helped me explore and practice:

- Multithreading, event-driven programming, and design patterns  
- Data structures, memory/resource management, and file parsing  
- Object-oriented and entity-hierarchy design  
- User interfacing and OpenGL programming  

## Project Details

- **Language:** Java  
- **Purpose:** Educational; building a 3D game engine and tools for collaboration  
- **Iterations:** The engine was restarted multiple times as design improved  
- **Challenges:** Difficulty implementing a multiple-document interface with a 3D context led to pausing the project until technology (e.g., WebGL) became more practical  

## Status

This project is discontinued as a working engine. It serves as a historical snapshot of my early learning in systems design, graphics programming, and engine architecture.
